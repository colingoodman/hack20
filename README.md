# In A Nutshell

This was a project for the 2020 K-State Hackathon. It is a website that fetches trending news stories and uses natural language processing to summarize them. The goal was to create a quick and easy way to stay informed amid the chaos of the 24 hour news cycle. 

The front end was built with Node. The back end was built in Python. There was no database used in the Hackathon submission.

Libraries we used:
